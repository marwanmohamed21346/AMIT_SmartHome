ABOUT PROJECT:
--------------
• it is a popular project nowadays, it is a very comfortable application for humans, it aims to convert any thing around to be controllable and smart.
• At the following we have some requirement to implement smart home application:

+ Remoted controlled by mobile or lab top.

+ For emergency cases or controlling without mobile or lap top use LCD and Keypad “user mode only”.

+ The controllable things are 6 lamps “5 on/off lamps, one dimming lamp”, door, air condition according to the ambient temperature.

+ Login system admin and user “admin is remoted only”.

+ Admin mode can register any user or remove.

+ Usernames and password must be kept into memory even if the system is powered off.

+ If admin or any user or passwords are entered wrong more than 3 trial, the system must break down and fire alarm until reset.

+ Admin and user can access to all applies except user cannot control the door opening.


Specifications LCD& keypad:
---------------------------
1.They are used to login to system as a user only.
2.After login, user can control all features except opening door.
3.They can control the system even if any user login by remoted mode except admin until allowing of admin.
4.The interfacing of LCD must display the running devices if the keypad LCD system is not used.
5.The user’s usernames in this system different than the user’s usernames in the remoting system.

Specifications EEPROM:
----------------------
1.Storing the new user to the system.
2.It must be Read/write in admin mode.
3.It must be read only in user mode.

Specifications TTL/Bluetooth:
-----------------------------
1.Transmitting/Receiving between MC and PC/mobile.
2.Every action, Message must be printed on Mobile/PC screen, like: Hey, please Enter your username:.
3.Transmitting/Receiving the commands to run the system.

Specifications Lamps, Relay, Dimmer:
------------------------------------
1.Lamps must be isolated because of high power.
2.Dimmer is a circuit that can control on the current flow to lamp depending on the input voltage “0 5V”.

Specifications Temperature Sensor, DC motor:
---------------------------------------------
Temperature sensor reads the ambient temperature, if the temperature is higher than 2828°C, Air condition must be run “DC motor”, if the temperature becomes lower than 2121°C, Air condition must be turned off “DC motor”

Specifications Door:
--------------------
The actuator used is a servo motor to control the opening door only in admin mode, it is controlled by command which is send by Mobile/PC “Open Close the door”

Components:
-----------
1. 24C08 EEPROM, or use the internal.
2. Bluetooth module HC 05 or TTL (PL2003 or CH340or CP2102).
3. 5 transistors and relays (Not mandatory they can be replaced by LEDs).
4. 1 transistor and Solid state Relay for dimming circuit.
5. LM35 temperature sensor or equivalent.
6. 2 NPN and DC motor
7. Keypad Lm01602A Character LCD.
8. Servo motor.
